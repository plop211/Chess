    <h1>FAVOURTE CHESS PIECES</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2 id="Pawn-Piece">The Pawn</h2>
    <p>
      <b>The Pawn</b> is one of my favourite chess pieces because of its ability
      to work with other pawns and to become <I>promoted.</I> Pawn chains can be very
      powerful and a pawn can be promoted to another piece if it reaches the
      other side of the chess board.
